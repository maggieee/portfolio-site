<h4>Hey there,</h4>
<h1>I'm Maggie Ronan</h1>
<h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
<br></br>
<p>I got my first taste of working in tech doing marketing at a startup in 2009. There, I was first introduced to software engineering and thought to myself: "I want to be *making* the product thatâ€™s getting sold."
<br></br><br></br>
10 years and a variety of jobs and academic pursuits later, I am excited to be back on the software engineering career track. I hope to combine the software engineering skills I have cultivated at Hackbright Academy, along with elements from my previous background -- testing and tracking down bugs from QA, collaboration and prioritization of issues from Release Management, and caring about the frontend from Art/Fashion/Film -- to be a kick-butt teammate in my first Software Engineering role.
